(jthan packaged cryptcat. yay!)

also implement https://github.com/thp/urlwatch support because:
-it's in the repos
-it's a bit more handy than pkgoutofdate
-Pushover support via chump \o/

in README, need to mention HOW to use scripts- and how to sign packages, how to upload GPG key to keyservers, etc.


python rewrite of new packages is almost done. the biggest part is done, anyways- still need the other menu options fleshed out and to bring it all together under a __main__

python packages: see https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=python-gitdb2 for example


-remove python-conversion

- todo: package:
ruby-prawn
ruby-addressable
ruby-prawn-svg
ruby-prawn-templates
asciidoctor-pdf

can i use beautifulsoul/urllib/etc. to submit a comment once the package is added? if so:

# Bug reports can be filed at https://bugs.square-r00t.net/index.php?project=3
# News updates for packages can be followed at https://devblog.square-r00t.net

(If you want an RSS-feed only pertaining to my AUR packages, you can subscribe to https://devblog.square-r00t.net/rss/?category=aur in your favourite RSS reader.)

Note that you should still use the AUR web interface for flagging packages as out-of-date if a new version is released; the aforementioned bug tracker is to aid in issues with building/packaging/the PKGBUILD formats/etc. specifically.

GPG signature "errors" are explained here:
https://devblog.square-r00t.net/articles/a-note-on-using-gpg-signatures-in-pkgbuilds

Please read; it's not a bug.


Thanks!
