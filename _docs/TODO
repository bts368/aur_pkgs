(jthan packaged cryptcat. yay!)

also implement https://github.com/thp/urlwatch support because:
-it's in the repos
-it's a bit more handy than pkgoutofdate
-Pushover support via chump \o/

in README, need to mention HOW to use scripts- and how to sign packages, how to upload GPG key to keyservers, etc.


python rewrite of new packages is almost done. the biggest part is done, anyways- still need the other menu options fleshed out and to bring it all together under a __main__
